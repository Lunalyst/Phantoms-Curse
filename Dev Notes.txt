//odd way of setting up a hitbox witout my hitbox class. useful for maketext object.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/71600390/phaser-3-increase-drag-click-area-size-of-sprite

use classes tab as a guide for how to set up the header. each object has different phaser.physics.arcade
// important. to fix tile bleeding we follow the guide here using tile extruder.
https://github.com/sporadic-labs/tile-extruder
//use this code in cmd
// dont forget our tiles are 96 by 96 then downscaled by a third
//tile-extruder --tileWidth 96 --tileHeight 96 --input ./Downloads/Forest_Large_Tiles.png --output ./Downloads/extruded.png


for new tileset, 
Orthogonal
Base64 (uncompressed)
Right Down.

then add the tileset in on the left. remeber to give tiles the collision boolean property for tiles that have colliders.
colliders that are one way(like the platforms) are define here. do not give those collision in tiled.

how to monitor performance and isolate problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDcNGwxAvKY

for the sake of being aware of some good practices to prevent gameplay lag, 
- make sure overlap function are called as little as possible in the update loop.
- reuse sprites whenever possible.
- try to keep loops in the update loop to a minimum
- if lag occurs use the performance tab to record the lg, then use the bottom up tab to find whats causing it
likely if its a generic phaser 3 function like collide object then there are too many overlap or collision calls.

dialogue manager example.
//make a node class, that has a array of nodes as children, and use that for dialogue so it isnt a nightmare.
//what is our node class made of?
//this data is in  text file, or some other sotrage location.

//node class traversed dialogue, then generates a tree structure with dialogue in it.
//parses through a json file.

 1) dialogue specifically 3 lines of text.
 2) profile picture
 3) text voice



 //need a class which traverses the dialogue tree, using the nodes as states for a state machine.
 if the traversal finds a node that has a dialogue length that is greater than our character limit of 3 lines,
 have a way to dynamically add a new node between this one, and the next that shares the same profile, textboxvoice

pares through, using charactername->dataforScene->flag
in this flag value holds the nodes.
we traverse these nodes adding them to an dictionary which had indexes

if(dict[key] === 0){


}

when making a container and adding object keep in mind the graph above for where it should be placed when setting up its x and y position.

constructor error?

wierd bug where tileset isnt embedded correctly? beware bad tiles leftover from converting old levels to new tilesets.
tiles can linger over that are out of range of the tileset, causing this error.
