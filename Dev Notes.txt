how to extrude tileset to avoid tile bleeding
https://github.com/sporadic-labs/tile-extruder

use classes tab as a guide for how to set up the header. each object has different phaser.physics.arcade
// important. to fix tile bleeding we follow the guide here using tile extruder.
https://github.com/sporadic-labs/tile-extruder
//use this code in cmd
// dont forget our tiles are 96 by 96 then downscaled by a third
//tile-extruder --tileWidth 96 --tileHeight 96 --input ./Downloads/Forest_Large_Tiles.png --output ./Downloads/extruded.png

for new tileset, 
Orthogonal
Base64 (uncompressed)
Right Down.

then add the tileset in on the left. remeber to give tiles the collision boolean property for tiles that have colliders.
colliders that are one way(like the platforms) are define here. do not give those collision in tiled.

how to monitor performance and isolate problems.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mDcNGwxAvKY

for the sake of being aware of some good practices to prevent gameplay lag, 
- make sure overlap function are called as little as possible in the update loop.
- reuse sprites whenever possible.
- try to keep loops in the update loop to a minimum
- if lag occurs use the performance tab to record the lg, then use the bottom up tab to find whats causing it
likely if its a generic phaser 3 function like collide object then there are too many overlap or collision calls.
