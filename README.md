this is a 2D adventure platformer game.

controls

W A S D to move

SHIFT to attack(you need to equip a weapon, which can be done so in your inventory.)

SPACE to jump

TAB to open inventory. click on items to move them between slots. book icon opens up bestiary.

something important to node is that there are tunnels that allow you to to traverse between locations. however I'm working on a button indication of when to press W to enter them. so if you see a whole in the wall try pressing w.
enemy's are slimes. they do try to eat you so be careful.
